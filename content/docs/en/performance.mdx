description: How's the performance of Ada?

## Ada is fast. 

On a benchmark where we need to validate and normalize [thousands URLs found
on popular websites](https://github.com/ada-url/url-various-datasets/tree/main/top100), 
we find that ada can be several times faster than popular competitors (system: Apple MacBook 2022
with LLVM 14).

```
ada ▏  188 ns/URL ███▏
servo url ▏  664 ns/URL ███████████▎
CURL ▏ 1471 ns/URL █████████████████████████
```

Ada has improved the performance of the popular JavaScript environment Node.js:

> Since Node.js 18, a new URL parser dependency was added to Node.js — Ada. This addition bumped the Node.js performance when parsing URLs to a new level. Some results could reach up to an improvement of **400%**. ([State of Node.js Performance 2023](https://blog.rafaelgss.dev/state-of-nodejs-performance-2023))
