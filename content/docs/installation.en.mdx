---

<Alert>
  <AlertDescription>
    Ada is available on different programming languages such as **C++**, **Python**, **Go** or **Rust**. 
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

## Homebrew

Ada is available through [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ada-url#default).
Homebrew is kept up to date with the recent releases of Ada.

Run the following command to install Ada to your macOS computer:

```bash
brew install ada-url
```

## Build from source

### Requirements

The project is self-contained and has no dependency.
A recent C++ compiler supporting C++17. We test GCC 9 or better, LLVM 10 or better and Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.

### Compiling

<Alert>
  <AlertDescription>
    Ada uses **cmake** as a build system. It's recommended to have cmake available in your system.
  </AlertDescription>

</Alert>

Run the following commands to compile and build Ada locally.

<Steps>

  ### Prepare build
  
  The following command prepares the build.

  ```bash
  cmake -B build
  ```

  ### Build
  
  Run the following command to build Ada on your system.

  ```bash
  cmake --build build
  ```
  
  ### Run tests
  
  Run the following `ctest` command to validate your build.
  
  ```bash
  ctest --output-on-failure --test-dir build
  ```

</Steps>

### Windows

Windows users need additional flags to specify the build configuration, e.g. `--config Release`.

The project can also be built via docker using default docker file of repository with following commands.

```bash
docker build -t ada-builder . && docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/repo ada-builder
```

### Amalgamation

You may amalgamate all source files into only two files (`ada.h` and `ada.cpp`) by typing executing the Python
3 script `singleheader/amalgamate.py`. By default, the files are created in the `singleheader` directory.

```bash
./singleheader/amalgamate.py
```
