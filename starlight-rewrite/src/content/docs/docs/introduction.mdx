  The term WHATWG stands for **Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group**.
  It is a community-driven organization that focuses on developing and maintaining
  web standards. The WHATWG was initially formed in response to the divergence between
  the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the browser vendors at the time, who felt
  that the W3C process was too slow to address the evolving needs of web developers.
